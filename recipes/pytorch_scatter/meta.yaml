  summary: 'PyTorch Extension Library of Optimized Scatter Operations'
  description: |
    This package consists of a small extension library of highly optimized
    sparse update (scatter) operations for the use in PyTorch, which are
    missing in the main package. Scatter operations can be roughly described as
    reduce operations based on a given "group-index" tensor. All included
    operations are broadcastable, work on varying data types, and are
    implemented both for CPU and GPU with corresponding backward
    implementations.
